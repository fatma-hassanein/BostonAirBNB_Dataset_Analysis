# BostonAirBNB Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project is implemented using python and its libraries to implement Data Science process on the Boston AirBNB dataset for a Udacity Nanodegree Project.
The analysis done on the dataset was meant to answer the below questions:

1. When was the most expensive month to rent in Boston ?
2. What is the average availability each month ?
3. What is the most used cancelation policy in Boston ?
4. What is the average review score for Boston residences ?
5. Is the reviews correlated with the price ?

## Contents

The repo contains the python file that has all the detailed documented code for the analysis. In addition, it has a md file a blog for my findings and an images folder with the figures used to visualize these findings.

## Conclusion

The results correlated with the visualization is available in my blog.md file inside this repo.
